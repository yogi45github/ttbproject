## 4. Highlight Features


### Auto or manual approval                                                                                                                                                               
One of the most noticeable features of Customer Approval is that the store owner can give accept customers’ account registration automatically or manually.  

In case the approval is automatic, customers will be approved immediately when finishing account registration and can log in easily. By contrast, if store owners would like to control carefully visitors, the approval can be managed manually from store backend. 

This flexibility in the approval methods supports stores in specific purposes and strategies, suitably in various types of business, various strategies in different periods.

### Error Notice or redirect

What will happen when customers try to log in without approved accounts? Customer Approval offers two options with different actions: Error Notice or Redirect.

#### Error notice 

In case a customer uses their accounts which have not received permission to log in, an error notice will appear to notify them with a specific message. Admins can set any messages with ease from the backend. 


#### Redirect visitors to another page

In another way, customers whose accounts have not approved yet can be redirected to a specific page configured by the store admin. This is the page which is allowed to freely access without accounts or a simple notice page. 

The store owner can choose redirected URL which suits a particular purpose such as introduction or marketing and so on. This navigation can avoid customers to feel disappointed or annoyed by their login failure. They take time with the recommended page and wait for the account acceptance.

### Mass or Partial Approval
Another feature of Customer Approval is multi-select to approve or disapproved many accounts on the backend list. From admin backend, admins can select one, many or all customer accounts. Then, the select accounts can be approved or disapproved by just one click on a button as Approve or Not Approve quickly.

This helps admin can save a deal of time significantly in case there are a number of customer accounts waiting for verification. Moreover, it is very easy to change the status of already-approved accounts to prevent from login for some reason.
